# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Gender Breakdown
### NYC vs Des Moines
1,530,272 M
588,431 F
225,521 UNK
About 65.27% of the CitiBike customers in NYC are male. Now, according to the United States Census Bureau "QuickFacts" Des Moines data, 49.2% of the population identifies as either Male or Unknown. This means that we can have a sense of security when talking about meeting our target goals as far as customers go. Since there are more females than males in De Moines, we have the opportunity to cater to the female population. Perhaps biking can be made popular for the female population.

## Starting Points
### NYC vs Des Moines
The top starting locations in NYC were near parks. This is an interesting find because Des Moines has about 75 parks and more than 800 miles of biking trails located throughout the city. CitiBikes can be stationed at these locations (near parks or bike trails) in order to gain more traction.

## Average Trip Duration
### NYC vs Des Moines
Average trip durations in NYC increase the older that an individual is (i.e. the earlier the birth year, the more likely the person will take a longer trip). It must be noted that people above the age of 65 years took longer trips but individuals who were born between 1955 and the early 2000s obtained bike trip lengths that steadily increased each year in NYC. It must be noted that 11.8% of Des Moines' population is above the age of 65 and 56.9% of the population is between 18 and 64 years of age. Thus, the progress in Des Moines can be very similar to that of NYC.

## Bike Utilization
### NYC vs Des Moines
The darkest circles indicate which bikes were utilized the most. This would help us in identifying which bikes need the fastest repairs. The visualization that we see on this slide shows us that it is, indeed, feasible to repair these bikes at a feasible rate. This also shows us that such an act would be feasible in Des Moines as well.

## August Peak Hours
### NYC vs Des Moines
Peak hours in NYC occured between the following hours: 9 a.m. and 4-8 p.m. The "slowest" times in NYC were between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. This timeframe in particular would be the best time to perform bike repairs, which would minimize the amount of revenue lost for the company. Now, if we take a look at Des Moines, some of the most popular sites are open at hours that are very similar to the data that we see here. For instance, Downtown Des Moines Farmer's Market is #2 in the nation. Its hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to noon. Since this location is very popular, there is a high possibility that a large amount of folks will show up. The utilization of bikes in such a popular area would be the best way for CitiBike customers to 1) avoid worrying about finding parking and 2) avoid traffic. Other popular locations in Des Moines are operating during NYC's peak hours. Since the stats from both cities are very similar, it is safe to assume that our repairs would run in the same fashion.

## Bike Repairs
### NYC vs Des Moines
This slide is very similar to our slide that talked about bike utilization. Again, this is a great way to indicate which bikes need repairs sooner. We can use this same type of visualization in order to determine the progress of bike usage in Des Moines.

## Final Thoughts
Gender and age played a huge factor in determining whether or not CitiBike would be effective in another location (i.e. Des Moines). After analyzing the similarities between NYC and Des Moines with regards to types of customers (i.e. gender and age) and city attractions, it is evident that such a business would flourish in Des Moines.
